# -XX:ActiveProcessorCount doesn't limit the number of available cores as we might think
# It also doesn't isolate cores, meaning the cores the java process uses could be shared with other workloads
# See https://github.com/quarkusio/spring-quarkus-perf-comparison/issues/73
#
# On quarkus 3 (without virtual threads): -XX:ActiveProcessorCount wont't constrain the size of our (blocking) worker pool using platform threads,
# allowing it to consume more than the suggested number of processors
#
# On quarkus 3 (with virtual threads) : -XX:ActiveProcessorCount correctly enforce the Loom ForkJoin pool handling VirtualThreads to be sized correctly (in term of platform threads).
# This won't still honor the suggested number of processors, because we internally size the Netty event loop count equal to the number of cores (i.e -XX:ActiveProcessorCount),
# meaning that the total number of threads is -XX:ActiveProcessorCount * 2 (i.e. event loop count + loom fork join pool + GC threads + compiler threads) > -XX:ActiveProcessorCount
#
# On Spring with virtual threads, tomcat fully run it, and they handle blocking calls there too, meaning that the total number of platform threads honor -XX:ActiveProcessorCount
#
# When running in the lab environment (see perf-lab/run-benchmarks.sh & perf-lab/main.yml), this is taken care of by using taskset on Linux.
